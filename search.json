Historically, teams will play better on their own court. Since they aren’t dealing with unfamiliar surroundings, unsupportive crowds, and travel fatigue, it is an advantage. But in today’s game, where each player becomes better than the last-the question arises: is home-court advantage still as impactful across conferences as it used to be?\nTo find out-let’s take a look at conference winning percentages and how they are affected by home and away games.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(ggtext)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(wehoop)\n\nbasketball &lt;- read_csv(\"~/R Projects/SPMC Homework/BasketballStats.csv\")\n\npercentage &lt;- basketball |&gt;\n  filter(is.na(Conference) == FALSE) |&gt; \n  group_by(Conference) |&gt; \n  summarize(\n    total_games = sum(OverallGames),\n    total_wins = sum(OverallWins),\n    total_conf_wins = sum(ConferenceWin),\n    total_conf_losses = sum(ConferenceLoss),\n    total_conf_home_wins = sum(HomeWin),\n    total_conf_home_losses = sum(HomeLoss),\n    total_conf_away_losses = sum(AwayLoss),\n    total_conf_away_wins = sum(AwayWin)\n  ) |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    conference_winning_pct = total_wins / total_games,\n    conference_home_winning_pct = total_conf_wins / (total_conf_home_wins + total_conf_home_losses),\n    conference_away_winning_pct = total_conf_wins / (total_conf_away_wins + total_conf_away_losses)\n  )\n\nbig10 &lt;- percentage |&gt; \n  filter(\n    Conference == \"Big Ten\"\n  )\n\nbig12 &lt;- percentage |&gt; \n  filter(\n    Conference == \"Big 12\"\n  )\n\nMW &lt;- percentage |&gt; \n  filter(\n    Conference == \"Mountain West\"\n  )\n\nSEC &lt;- percentage |&gt; \n  filter(\n    Conference == \"SEC\"\n  )\n\nMAC &lt;- percentage |&gt; \n  filter(\n    Conference == \"MAC\"\n  )\n\npatriot &lt;- percentage |&gt; \n  filter(\n    Conference == \"Patriot\"\n  )\n\nivy &lt;- percentage |&gt; \n  filter(\n    Conference == \"Ivy League\"\n  )\n\nbigten &lt;- percentage |&gt;\n  filter(\n    Conference == \"Big Ten\"\n  )\n\nstat &lt;- percentage |&gt; \n  select(Conference, conference_home_winning_pct, conference_away_winning_pct) |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = -Conference, \n    names_to = \"Type\",\n    values_to = \"Percentage\"\n  )\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=stat, aes(x=reorder(Conference, percentage), weight=Percentage, fill=Type)) +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(\n  x=\"Conferences\",\n  y=\"Conference Home and Away Win Percentages\",\n  title=\"There's no place like home-until teams win while away.\",              \n  subtitle=\"Conferences post higher winning percentages in conference away games, challenging home-court advantage.\", \n    caption=\"Source: NCAA | By Madalyn Fox\"\n  ) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"conference_away_winning_pct\" = \"red\",\n                               \"conference_home_winning_pct\" = \"darkgrey\"),\n                    labels = c(\"conference_away_winning_pct\" = \"Away\",\n                               \"conference_home_winning_pct\" = \"Home\")\n  ) +\n  guides(fill = guide_legend(title = \"Conference Winning Percentages\")) +\n  theme_minimal() + \n   theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome conferences, and teams, consistently have a higher away winning percentages when playing teams in their own conference.\nWhat do the numbers look like?\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_point(\n    data=percentage,\n    aes(x=total_conf_away_wins, y=total_conf_home_wins, size=total_wins), \n    color =\"darkgrey\",\n    alpha = .3) +\n  scale_size(range = c(1,10), name=\"Total Wins\") +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=percentage,\n    aes(x=total_conf_away_wins, y=total_conf_home_wins, label=Conference) \n   ) +\n  geom_point(\n    data=big10,\n    aes(x=total_conf_away_wins, y=total_conf_home_wins, size=total_wins), \n    color =\"red\",\n    alpha = .3) +\n  labs(\n    x= \"Total Conference Home Wins\",\n    y= \"Total Conference Away Wins\",\n    title =  \"Big Ten has more wins on both courts.\",\n    subtitle=\"The Big Ten Conference, has more away and home wins than other conferences.\",\n    caption= \"Source: Sports Reference | By Madalyn Fox\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() + \n   theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Big Ten is more than 5% higher than the ACC when playing on the road, which is a notable margin.
