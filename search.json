Since they aren’t dealing with unfamiliar surroundings, unsupportive crowds, and travel fatigue, it is an advantage. But in today’s game, where each player becomes better than the last-the question arises: is home-court advantage still as impactful across conferences as it used to be?\nTo find out- let’s take a look at conference winning percentages and how they are affected by home and away games.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.4     ✔ readr     2.1.5\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.1\n✔ ggplot2   3.5.1     ✔ tibble    3.2.1\n✔ lubridate 1.9.4     ✔ tidyr     1.3.1\n✔ purrr     1.0.2     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(ggalt)\n\nRegistered S3 methods overwritten by 'ggalt':\n  method                  from   \n  grid.draw.absoluteGrob  ggplot2\n  grobHeight.absoluteGrob ggplot2\n  grobWidth.absoluteGrob  ggplot2\n  grobX.absoluteGrob      ggplot2\n  grobY.absoluteGrob      ggplot2\n\nlibrary(ggtext)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(wehoop)\n\nbasketball &lt;- read_csv(\"~/R Projects/SPMC Homework/BasketballStats.csv\")\n\nNew names:\nRows: 364 Columns: 37\n── Column specification\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────── Delimiter: \",\" chr\n(2): Team, Conference dbl (31): OverallGames, OverallWins, OverallLoss,\nOverallW-L%, OverallSRS, O... lgl (4): ...11, ...14, ...17, ...20\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data. ℹ\nSpecify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n• `` -&gt;
