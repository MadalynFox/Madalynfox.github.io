    "text": "Home-court advantage in college basketball is real, but maybe not as powerful as it once was. Historically, teams will play better on their own court. Since they aren’t dealing with unfamiliar surroundings, unsupportive crowds, and travel fatigue, it is an advantage. But in today’s game, where each player becomes better than the last-the question arises: is home-court advantage still as impactful across conferences as it used to be?\nTo find out-let’s take a look at conference winning percentages and how they are affected by home and away games.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(ggtext)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(wehoop)\n\nbasketball &lt;- read_csv(\"~/R Projects/SPMC Homework/BasketballStats.csv\")\n\npercentage &lt;- basketball |&gt;\n  filter(is.na(Conference) == FALSE) |&gt;

Some teams maintain competitive point margins away from home, while other teams just struggle significantly when playing on the road.\nIn the end, home-court advantage may still matter, but it’s clear that in today’s college basketball landscape, the best teams will find ways to win—regardless of the court they’re playing on."

    "text": "With Rory McIlroy finally completing the Grand Slam, one question remains. Who will win the next major tournament? The PGA Championship is scheduled for May 15-18, 2025, and there is plenty of time to place bets. Statistically, the favorites are Rory McIlroy, Scottie Scheffler, Bryson DeChambeau, and defending champion Xander Schauffele - just to name a few. Some other big names include Justin Thomas fresh off his win at the RBC Heritage tournament and the United States Ryder Cup Team Captain Keegan Bradley. Jordan Spieth is also on the radar with the PGA Championship being the last to complete his Grand Slam.\nWhen it comes to majors, it can be the short game that separates the champions from the cut line.

But while Scottie Scheffler continues to dominate leaderboards, he ranks among the worst in putting averages. On the other hand, Justin Thomas—who has one of the best putting averages on tour. He brings proven success at this very tournament, having won the PGA Championship in both 2017 and 2022. Still, putting is only one piece of the puzzle. On a course like Valhalla, where length and precision are rewarded, performance off the tee can be just as critical. Driving distance and accuracy often set the tone for scoring opportunities—and mistakes.\n\n\nCode\ntopplayers &lt;- rankingsnew |&gt;\n  filter(\n    PLAYER == \"Scottie Scheffler\" |\n    PLAYER == \"Sepp Straka\" |\n    PLAYER == \"Rory McIlroy\" |\n    PLAYER == \"Justin Thomas\" |\n    PLAYER == \"Russell Henley\" |\n    PLAYER == \"Jordan Spieth\" |\n    PLAYER == \"Keegan Bradley\" |\n    PLAYER == \"Ludvig √Öberg\"\n  )\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_point(data=rankingsnew, aes(x=`ACCURACY RANK`, y=`DISTANCE RANK`, size=`PGA RANKING`),\n    alpha = .1) +\n  scale_size(range = c(10, 1), name=\"PGA Ranking\") +\ngeom_point(\n  data=Scottie, \n  aes(x=`ACCURACY RANK`, y=`DISTANCE RANK`, size=`PGA RANKING`), color=\"lightblue\") +\n  geom_point(\n    data=Rory, \n    aes(x=`ACCURACY RANK`, y=`DISTANCE RANK`, size=`PGA RANKING`), color=\"lightgreen\") +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 75.0) +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 75.0) +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=topplayers,\n    aes(x=`ACCURACY RANK`, y=`DISTANCE RANK`, label=PLAYER)) + \n  geom_text(aes(x=30, y=20, label=\"Good Rankings\"), color=\"blue\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=120, y=150, label=\"Bad Rankings\"), color=\"blue\") +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Accuracy Ranking\", \n    y=\"Distance Ranking\", \n    title=\"Power and precision aren't everything\", \n    subtitle=\"Top performers rank outside the best driving distance and accuracy zones.\", \n    caption=\"Source: PGA | By Madalyn Fox\"\n    ) + \n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size =15, face = \"bold\"),\n     axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=9), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe lower the better, and in this case, Jordan Spieth and Keegan Bradley outrank some of the world’s top players. Both are excelling in driving distance and accuracy—two key factors at a course like Valhalla. Spieth has quietly put together one of his most consistent seasons off the tee, while Bradley’s precision continues to keep him in contention, especially on tight setups.\nLooking at overall strokes gained—a statistic that combines performances from driving, approach shots, short game, and putting—some players are consistently at the top. It is a reliable way to measure which players are truly playing the most well-rounded golf heading into the next major.\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + geom_bar(data=strokesgainedplayers, aes(x=reorder(PLAYER,SGAVG), weight=SGAVG)) +\ngeom_bar(data=SS, aes(x=reorder(PLAYER,SGAVG), weight=SGAVG), fill=\"lightblue\") +\n  geom_bar(data=RM, aes(x=reorder(PLAYER,SGAVG), weight=SGAVG), fill=\"lightgreen\") +\n  coord_flip() + \n  labs(\n    x=\"\", \n    y=\"Average Stokes Gained\", \n    title=\"Built to win, at least on paper\", \n    subtitle=\"Strokes gained trends highlight the top two players to win the next major.\", \n    caption=\"Source: PGA | By Madalyn Fox\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile this analysis excludes LIV players due to the unavailability of data, the numbers are still strong predictors of who’s trending upward heading into the PGA Championship. By strokes gained in key areas, Scottie Scheffler, Keegan Bradley, and Justin Thomas are all top competitors. Rory McIlroy also has a strong chance but since he won the first major of the year it is unlikely he will win another. Each is well-suited to handle major championship pressure—and has a real chance to lift the Wanamaker Trophy."
